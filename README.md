# SpartaSimulation

## How to Use

No configuration is needed. Dowanload the project and open in IntelliJ IDEA (Community edition works). When running the program, two user inputs will be required:
 - Number of MONTHS you want the simulation to run for - up to a maximim of 1200 months (100 years).
 - Whether or not you want monthly updates as the simulation runs ('y' or  'n' input)
 
 The program outputs the following:
  - Number of months passed
  - Number of training centres currently open
  - Number of open boot camps filled to capacity
  - number of training hubs filled to capacity
  - total number of trainees training across all open boot camps
  - Total number of trainees waiting to be assigned to an available training centre
  - Number of open boot camps with space remaining
  - Number of training hubs with space remaining
  - Number of boot camps closed over the course of the simulation
  - Number of training hubs closed over the course of the simulation.
  
  The output is delivered to the console in text form.
