# SpartaSimulation

## How to Use

No configuration is needed. Download the project and open it in IntelliJ IDEA (Community edition works). When running the program, two user inputs will be required:

-	Number of MONTHS you want the simulation to run for - up to a maximum of 1200 months (100 years).
-	Whether or not you want monthly updates as the simulation runs ('y' or 'n' input)


The program outputs the following:
-	The number of months passed
-	The number of training centres currently open
-	The number of open boot camps filled to capacity
-	The number of training hubs filled to capacity
-	The total number of trainees training across all open boot camps
-	The total number of trainees waiting to be assigned to an available training centre
-	The number of open boot camps with space remaining
-	The number of training hubs with space remaining
-	The number of boot camps closed over the course of the simulation
-	The number of training hubs closed over the course of the simulation.

The output is delivered to the console in text form
